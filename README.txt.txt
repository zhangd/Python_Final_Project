"RAINBOWS AND UNICORNS"

A deceptively simple, fast-paced, and infinitely upward scrolling platformer.

Made by Vardaan Gurung, Matthew Ko, and David Zhang.

To run the file, simply open up the game.py file and run. Make sure that the pictures unicorn.png and rainbow.png are in the folder as well. No additional packages than pygame are necessary.
